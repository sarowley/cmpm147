				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiment I wanted to create something that was more "game-like" in nature then any of the other pieces. The very first thing that came to mind was an endless runner with some form of parallax, like I've made before in previous CMPM classes I've taken. It ended up just being a simple "evade" game where your car is going left and you have to forever dodge another object that is slowly closing in on your location.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The game itself is technically very simple. I just add a constant velocity to the background, which wasn't hard, and then using P5.js's graphics capabilities, I created a box and two wheels that have the ability to take input and translate it into velocity, along with another randomly generated shape that slowly closes in on the player's position.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I was pretty happy with how this one turned out. I wanted something very "Mad Max" like, and I feel like while it's not the best looking, I did something that I'm proud of with what I was given. Something that I'm not happy with is that there's no auto-reset or reset button. I tried really hard to make it be replayable when you game overed, but I just couldn't get it working like how I wanted, while also playing nice with the hash function and world seed.</p>

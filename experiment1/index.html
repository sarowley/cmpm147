				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The main thing I was trying to accomplish with this experiment was to make a small humorous letter generator. I wanted to take the example random quest giver code, and while not doing anything too crazy, make it unique and add my own spin on it.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>What I did to make this generator work, was to copy the example given. And what that example did was when the page loads, and then on every subsequent button push, grab a random word from an array, and then slot that word into an appropriate place in a given sentence. It's very mad libs-esque.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This experiment wasn't too hard, and was pretty fun to work on, it just took a lot longer than I thought it would to set up, get working, and then turn in. Going through all the things on Canvas that walked through how to install everything and then held your hand through the assignment were beyond helpful. And in the end I made something that I'm proud of and think is pretty funny.</p>

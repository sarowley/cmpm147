				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project is a Voronoi diagram based genetic algorith that is used to recreate images using general shapes and colors.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>The algorithm starts by choosing a background color and a few points to base the Voronoi diagram around. It then goes through and for every 4th point will determine which Voronoi point it is closest to and chooses its respective color. It will then move the points around checking its fitness against an evaluation function to see how similar it is to the target image and mutating off of the best fit.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I really like how almost all the stuff that we created (involving the Voronoi Diagrams) looked, but other than the basics, and some rubber ducking, a lot of the more complicated stuff that Miles was doing went right over my head. I also don't know what's wrong with it, and I tried to fix it, but it runs really slow on my laptop and computer, but runs fine on Miles' stuff.</p>

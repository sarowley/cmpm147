				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				The main thing that I was trying to accomplish with this experiment was to create a living recreation of the painting "Hota Beach in Awa Province," which was painted by Katsushika Hokusai. I wanted it to look like the original, while also being random, with the ability to randomize the drawing with each "reimagine" push.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				What we did was use P5.js to recreate an image using geometric primatives and polygons. We then made it a "living" image, both in the sense that it slowly and rhytmically moves with the passing of time, along with it being random upon each page refresh or click of the "reimagine" button. It works by using a lot of funtions that are built into Javascript, like random(), along with things exclusive to P5.js like all of the noise functions we used to make the waves, forests, and cliffs.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				Sean: I really enjoyed working on this project. It was a lot of fun to slowly build a recreation of an image and see it come together geometric primative by geometric primative. We started working on it pretty early, so that was really nice, and we had a lot of times to think of different things we wanted to do and then actually implement them. A successes would be that we managed to make something that we are both proud of, the main failure of the project would probably be that we couldn't really make the grass on the cliff look like we wanted.
				<p></p>
				Miles: I found working with perlin noise to be very satisfying. I enjoyed making the mountain, cliffs, and waves randomly generate. Animating the waves was easier than I expected, just changing the perlin noise mapping at each frame.

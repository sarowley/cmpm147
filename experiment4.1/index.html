				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this first "Infinite World," Miles and I were trying to create a randomly generated crossword puzzle that would choose from a random JSON file of 270,000 words for every row and column, and then constraint satisfaction its way into making a perfect randomly generated crossword.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>As I mentioned before it uses constraint satisfaction to randomly choose a word that fits the requirements that we've given it. Those requirements are based off of the color of the tiles around it, if those tiles are filled with letters, and also how many tiles away it is from a black tile (which we use to determine how long to make the word). After looking around itself, it will then assign a word to the tiles around it, and that word can be unveiled by clicking the tiles that now have individual letters assigned to them.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I didn't work a whole lot on this one. I remixed the project from the template, and then messing around with it for a while, and while Miles and I were trying to decide what we should do with it, I accidentally made it look like a crossword and thought it was funny. Then I was thinking of some funny (but easy) things that we could do, and that's when Miles started working on the extremely hard implementation that you see before you.</p>

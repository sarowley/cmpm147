				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>With this experiment, Miles and I were trying to create some kind of cool eyeball that would follow wherever the mouse was, and then eventually for the aesthetic we decided on outer space. We also wanted to make sure that we used the hash and world seed to make it random in a unique and fun way that was different from the crossword.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>It chooses random tiles to place eyeballs and irises, and then deletes the tile it's on to get a cool "in the ground" look. It uses the coordinate points (0,0), which is the center of the tile, to place the eyeball, but the iris itself is placed where the mouse cursor is, but clamped by the radius of the eye, which gives it the apperance of being an iris that is moving around the eye looking for the mouse.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I really wanted to make the eyes follow the mouse, but I could only make them follow the mouse based on the center of the canvas. I looked up a bunch of tutorials and things to try and make the eyes follow the mouse, using things like sin() and cos() to clamp the iris from escaping the eyeball, but in the end I couldn't get it working exactly the way I wanted to, and settled with a point based eye tracking relative to the mouse.</p>
